# ESP8266-01 PowerBoard

This is a simple power supply board for the ESP8266-01.
For the moment, please don't use it. The drill holes for the ESP are to small. You won't be able to solder the ESP directly but using a socket works fine.!

NOTE: The drill holes for the ESP are to small to solder it directly onto the board!
But using a precision socket works fine!
